## Sysnopsis
**Random Spawn UF** is basically the same one-page interactive site as **Unicorn Farm**, except everytime you reload the browser, the unicorns load in random locations. This page is built with **HTML, CSS, JavaScript/jQuery**, & custom drawn images made with web application **Pixlr**.

## Motivation
To meet the requirements of the code challenge where Unicorns spawn randomly.
